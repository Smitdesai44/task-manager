 🌟 Django CRUD Operations Assignment




 📌 Objective


Create a Django web application that performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a single model.






 🛠️ Model to Use


Model Name: `Task`
Fields:


- `title` (CharField, max_length=200)
- `description` (TextField)
- `due_date` (DateTimeField)
- `is_completed` (BooleanField, default=False)






 📂 Documentation Structure to Follow


# 1. Project Setup


- Install Django and create a project named `task_manager`.
- Create an app named `tasks`.
- Add `tasks` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.




# 2. Model Definition


- Define the `Task` model in `models.py`.
- Run migrations:


```bash  
python manage.py makemigrations  
python manage.py migrate  
```




# 3. Admin Registration


- Register the `Task` model in `admin.py` to interact with it via Django’s admin interface.




# 4. CRUD Operations Implementation


 🔹 Create


- Create a form in `forms.py` for adding new tasks.
- Design a template (`create_task.html`) with a form to submit task details.
- Add a view to handle form submission and save data to the database.




 🔹 Read


- Create a view to display all tasks in a template (`task_list.html`).
- Include a "Detail" button to view individual task details in a new template (`task_detail.html`).




 🔹 Update


- Add an "Edit" button in `task_list.html` to modify existing tasks.
- Create an `update_task.html` template with a pre-filled form.
- Implement a view to save updated data.




 🔹 Delete


- Add a "Delete" button in `task_list.html`.
- Create a confirmation page (`delete_task.html`).
- Implement a view to remove tasks from the database.




# 5. URL Configuration


- Map URLs to views in `urls.py` (e.g., `/create/`, `/list/`, `/update/<id>/`, `/delete/<id>/`).






 🧪 Testing Requirements


- Ensure all CRUD operations work seamlessly.
- Handle edge cases (e.g., invalid form submissions).






 💡 Submission Guidelines


1. Share your GitHub repository link or code files.
2. Include a `README.md` with setup instructions.
3. Showcase screenshots of your working application.






 📝 Notes
- Use Django’s built-in class-based views (e.g., `CreateView`, `ListView`) or function-based views.
- Style your templates with CSS/Bootstrap for better UX.
- Bonus: Add a filter to sort tasks by due date or completion status.
